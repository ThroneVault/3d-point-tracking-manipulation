Fixes & Improvements
- For select_circle routine and subroutines, add messages with how to proceed
or escape functions, as well as improving how to "escape" them, with error
handling and print statements stating if the process was quit/interupted and
maybe the output if finished.
- Change settings for lines/circles/anything from hardcoded values to
variables fetched from the config file
